// ------1------
// const fruits = ["apple", "orange"];
// const vegetables = ["carrot", "potato"];

// const result = ['bread', ...vegetables, 'chicken', ...fruits];
// console.log(result);

//This code contains the spread operator to add elements from 'fruits' and 'vegetables'.
//The result array combines the vegetables with 'bread', 'chicken', and then adds the fruits, using the spread operator to include all the items from each array.
//Ð¡ontained in the final version 'bread', 'carrot', 'potato', 'chicken', 'apple', and 'orange'.

// ------2------
// const country = "USA";
// console.log([...country]);

////This code contains the spread operator "...Coountry" and used to spread 
///The spread operator `[...country]` separates each letter of the word "country" and puts them into their own separate boxes in a new group.

// ------Bonus------
// let newArray = [...[,,]];
// console.log(newArray);

///When spread into a new array using [...[,,]], it will copy the empty slots into the new array.
// If we log newArray, it will output something like [<2 empty items>], indicating there are two empty slots in the array.
